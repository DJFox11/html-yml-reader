# html-yml-reader

https://djfox11.github.io/html-yml-reader/ \
A simple `.YML` reader as a proof of concept for a project I am currently working on!

## Instructions

1. Open the downloaded `.YML` file by clicking the `Choose file` button.
2. Watch as the website reads the `.YML` file and outputs the kingdoms!

This only works with the downloaded file, I am working on *another* website that will read all sorts of information from the game's `.BYML`/`.YML` files.

## To-do
- [x] .YML Reading Capability
- [ ] Costumes
- [ ] NPCs
- [ ] Kingdom Layouts
